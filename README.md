WalesByBike
-----------

Wales by Bike is my personal project. I decided to create this example website to practise my front end development skills I've learned at [Treehouse](http://teamtreehouse.com/maratfaizov).

The site is responsive and built with HTML5, SCSS and jQuery. Map on the Contact page is customised using Google Maps API.
